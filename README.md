# FlipperIRCAT
IR File Concatenator 
I was working on this earlier this year trying to make an easier way to filter through one enormous text file, remove duds and create a IR database to make anything within 100 feet of it lose it's mind.  I am also planning a wedding so I haven't had time to update this, so hopefully some better at python than me or with more time than me can work on this. 


- All of my information from the IRDB is dated to May 2022, there could be major changes to how large, or how formatted it is, I just don't know.
- all2root.bat - Simple batch file to empty out folders into one folder for easier collection
- I used TXTCOLLECTOR to combine all of the files into one fat ir file
- As of right now, the IRCat.py file is configured to label everything as NUKE, I had intended to make a one button universal remote that would utilize this.
- If you try to execute one of these files, it will crash the flipper, there are too many duplicates and files with empty protocols that cannot be used.

Please don't make fun of my python skills I'll cry
