# FlipperIRCAT
IR File Concatenator 
I was working on this earlier this year trying to make an easier way to filter through one enormous text file, remove duds and create a IR database to make anything within 100 feet of it lose it's mind.  I am also planning a wedding so I haven't had time to update this, so hopefully some better at python than me or with more time than me can work on this.
